# sql-challenge

This challenge involves both the design and creation of a relational database schema (Data Modeling and Data Engineering) and performing data analysis by executing specific queries (Data Analysis). The ERD provides a visual representation of the relationships between tables, and the SQL queries help extract meaningful information from the data.

Data Modeling:
- Task: Inspect the CSV files and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- Use a tool like QuickDBD to create a visual representation of the tables and their relationships.

Data Engineering:
- Task: Create a table schema for each CSV file.
- Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints for each table.
- Verify uniqueness for primary keys or create composite keys if needed.
- Create tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.
- Import CSV files into corresponding SQL tables.
Load the data from each CSV file into the respective SQL table.
Queries:
- List employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary for each employee.
- List first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
- List the manager of each department with department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
- List department number for each employee with employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List first name, last name, and sex of employees named Hercules with last names starting with B.
- List each employee in the Sales department with employee number, last name, and first name.
- List each employee in Sales and Development departments with employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List frequency counts of employee last names in descending order.

Data Analysis:
- Task: Provide data analysis based on the queries.
- Execute the queries and analyze the results to draw insights or make observations.
